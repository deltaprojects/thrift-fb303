Description: Cross-language service framework (Facebook bassline)
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language
 services development. It combines a software stack with a
 code generation engine to build services that work efficiently
 and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl,
 Haskell, C#, Cocoa, Smalltalk, and OCaml.
